# DevOps Engineer | U.S. Air Force Veteran | Automation Expert | Cloud & Infrastructure Specialist

## The Power of Scripting Was Undeniable, But Accessing It Was Foreign‚ÄîThe Burning Desire to Understand the Unknown Sparked a Passion I‚Äôd Carry for Life

The journey began at **age 12** in **2006** with an old router, a broken Wi-Fi signal, and an unyielding curiosity about how networks functioned. As Wi-Fi technology expanded, frequent disconnections in distant parts of the house presented a technical challenge. A solution was quickly found: extending the signal using a repeater reverse-engineered from a **Linksys WRT54GL** router. After converting the router in under an hour, the signal improved but intermittent drops persisted.

**Wireshark** became an essential tool, exposing **dynamic IP conflicts**, fluctuating interference, and inefficient packet transmissions. This hands-on troubleshooting ignited a passion for **network optimization** and **automation**, laying the groundwork for a lifelong career in technology.

### Diving into Automation & Infrastructure Management

Seeking advanced solutions led to forums discussing **automation** and **scripting**, introducing languages like **Python** and **Bash**. Initial challenges with syntax and structure were quickly overcome through documentation, tutorials, and **GitHub** repositories. By **age 14**, automation became integral, streamlining not just personal projects but everyday life.

By **2007**, as **cloud computing** and **DevOps practices** emerged, hands-on experience with **Linux system administration**, **Apache configurations**, **cloud deployments**, and **VirtualBox virtualization** established a foundation in infrastructure management.

### Balancing Academics with Technical Growth

High school accelerated technical growth, but balancing academics with a growing passion for **automation** was challenging. By **10th grade**, time dedicated to scripting and infrastructure projects began to impact academic performance. To stay on track, custom automation tools were developed:

- üõ†Ô∏è **Automated Study Scheduler**: Scripted in Python to dynamically prioritize assignments and study schedules based on deadlines.
- üì° **Network Monitoring Tool**: Automated detection of network inconsistencies using early scripting techniques to optimize Wi-Fi performance.
- üìä **Data Logging System**: Simplified and automated data collection processes for academic projects and personal experiments.

These tools transformed manual academic processes into efficient workflows, allowing for technical growth without sacrificing academic success.
