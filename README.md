# About Me

**Full Stack Developer, Software Engineer, and Automation Expert** with over **18 years of hands-on experience** in software development, data architecture, network infrastructure, cloud computing, and cybersecurity. A **U.S. Air Force veteran** and former **Intelligence Analyst**, combining technical expertise with strategic problem-solving to deliver impactful solutions.

## My Journey

The journey began at **age 12** in **2006** with an old router, a broken Wi-Fi signal, and an unyielding drive to understand how networks function. As Wi-Fi technology expanded, frequent disconnections in distant parts of the house became a personal challenge. A solution was quickly found: extending the signal using a repeater reverse-engineered from a **Linksys WRT54GL** router. Luckily, two routers were available, and after following an online tutorial, the conversion was completed in under an hour. While the signal improved, intermittent drops persisted.

**Wireshark** became an invaluable tool, revealing **dynamic IP conflicts**, fluctuating interference, and inefficient packet transmissions. This deepened an interest in network troubleshooting and optimization, marking the start of a lifelong passion for technology.

### Diving into Automation & Programming

Searching for more advanced solutions led to forums discussing **programming** and **automation**, introducing a language called **Python**. Despite initial challenges with syntax, persistent study through documentation, tutorials, and **GitHub** exploration unlocked its potential. By **age 14**, scripting and automation became integral to daily life, with entire days dedicated to coding, debugging, and discovery.

By **2007**, as **cloud computing** and **DevOps** practices emerged, hands-on experience with **Linux server management**, **Apache configurations**, **MySQL database automation**, and **VirtualBox** set the foundation for future expertise.

### Balancing Academics and Technical Growth

High school brought rapid technical growth but also personal challenges. By **10th grade** at age **15**, dedication to coding and automation began impacting academic performance. To balance both, custom scripts were developed:

- üìö **Note Indexing Tool**: Automated indexing and categorization of notes for efficient studying.
- üóìÔ∏è **Assignment Tracker**: Dynamically monitored assignments and deadlines, prioritizing tasks from a personal planner.
- üìÑ **Document Formatter**: Automated document formatting and mathematical calculations using early Python libraries like `os`, `shutil`, and `regex`.

These tools transformed manual academic processes into efficient workflows, ensuring academic responsibilities were met without compromising technical growth.
